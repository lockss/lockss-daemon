This is the source tree for LOCKSS.  See http://www.lockss.org for
information about the project.

Obtaining Source
----------------

The latest version of this code can be obtained via CVS with

 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@lockss.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lockss
 cvs checkout lockss-daemon

Prerequisites
-------------

Installed Packages:

- Sun JDK 1.5 or greater.

- Ant 1.7.1 or greater.  (http://ant.apache.org/)

- Python is required in order to generate plugin jars and plugin signing
  keys, and to run some of the testing frameworks.

(On Debian or Ubuntu,
  apt-get install python sun-java6-jdk ant ant-optional
)


Other Prerequisites:

- Junit is included in the LOCKSS source distribution, but the Ant targets
  that invoke JUnit (test-xxx) require the JUnit jar to be on Ant's
  classpath.  The easiest way to do that is to copy lib/junit.jar into
  Ant's lib directory (<ant-install-dir>/ant/lib).

- For some of the tools the JAVA_HOME env var must be set to the directory
  in which the JDK is installed.
