This is the source tree for the LOCKSS daemon.
See http://www.lockss.org/ for information about the project.

Obtaining Source
----------------
A one-time copy can be obtained with wget or curl:

wget https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon/archive/master.zip`
or
curl -L -o master.zip https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon/archive/master.zip`

A buildable snapshot can be obtained by cloning the master branch:
git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon.git`

To establish a local copy of the LOCKSS git repository you can
use the “git clone” command to establish the repository and “git pull” to pull in updates:

git clone https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon.git` # to get working copy
git pull` # to update 

Prerequisites
-------------

Installed Packages:

- Sun or Open JDK 8.

- Ant 1.7.1 or greater.  (http://ant.apache.org/)

- Python 2.5 or greater (but not 3.x).

(On Debian or Ubuntu,
  apt-get install python sun-java7-jdk ant ant-optional
)

- In order to process split zip files, the command-line "zip" program must
  be installed.

Other Prerequisites:

- Junit is included in the LOCKSS source distribution, but the Ant targets
  that invoke JUnit (test-xxx) require the JUnit jar to be on Ant's
  classpath.  The easiest way to do that is to copy lib/junit.jar into
  Ant's lib directory (<ant-install-dir>/ant/lib).

- For some of the tools the JAVA_HOME env var must be set to the directory
  in which the JDK is installed.  (I.e., it's expected that tools.jar can
  be found in ${JAVA_HOME}/lib)

- Some of the tests require the command-line "zip" program to be installed.

ant test-all		Builds the system and runs all unit tests
ant test-one -Dclass=org.lockss.foo.TestBar
			        Builds the system and runs one JUnit test class.
