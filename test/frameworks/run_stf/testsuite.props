## For the most part, you don't need to change anything in this file.
## Edit only if you want to change the default behavior.

## Number of daemons to start
# daemonCount = 4

## Log level for the daemon
# daemonLogLevel = debug2

## Log level for the script
# scriptLogLevel = info

## projectDir is a top-level lockss-daemon project (if
## none is provided, walk up the path from current directory
## trying to find build.xml)
# projectDir = ../../..

## Top level work directory
# workDir = ./

## First port at which to start the daemons.
# startPort = 8041

## Timeout, in seconds.  Maximum time to wait for any event.
# timeout = 28800 # eight hours

## Clean up the work directories after a successful run?
# deleteAfterSuccess = True

## Delay shutdown until you hit the 'Enter' key to continue
# delayShutdown = False

## Hostname
# hostname = localhost

## Username
# username = testuser

## Password
# password = testpass

##
## Extra properties.  Anything starting with 'org.lockss.' will
## be passed to the daemon config.
##
##
## Example: Enable repair-from-cache as default.
##

# org.lockss.poll.v3.enablePerUrlAgreement=false
# org.lockss.poll.v3.repairFromCachePercent=90
# org.lockss.poll.v3.minPercentAgreementForRepairs=0
