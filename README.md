## LOCKSS-Daemon

This is the source tree for the LOCKSS daemon.
See [http://www.lockss.org/](#) for information about the LOCKSS project.

### Obtaining Source
A one-time copy can be obtained with wget or curl:

`wget https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon/archive/master.zip`

or

`curl -L -o master.zip https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon/archive/master.zip`

A buildable snapshot can be obtained by cloning the master branch
`git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon.git`

To establish a local copy of the LOCKSS git repository you can
use the “git clone” command to establish the repository and “git pull” to pull in updates:

`git clone https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon.git`

To update the local copy run within you local lockss-daemon dir:

`git pull`

### Building and Installing

### Dependencies:
- Sun JDK 7.  Java 8 is not yet supported.
- Ant 1.7.1 or greater.  (http://ant.apache.org/)
- Python 2.5 or greater (but not 3.x).

On Debian or Ubuntu you can grab all of the above with:

`apt-get install python sun-java7-jdk ant ant-optional`

### Other Dependencies:

#### Junit
Junit is included in the LOCKSS source distribution, but the Ant targets that invoke JUnit (test-xxx) require the JUnit jar to be on Ant's classpath.  The easiest way to do that is to copy lib/junit.jar into Ant's lib directory (\<ant-install-dir\>/ant/lib) or your local .ant/lib directory.

##### JAVA_HOME Environment variable
For some of the tools the JAVA_HOME env var must be set to the directory in which the JDK is installed.  (I.e., it's expected that tools.jar can be found in $JAVA_HOME/lib)

### To Build
-`ant test-all`

Builds the system and runs all unit tests

-`ant test-one -Dclass=org.lockss.foo.TestBar`

Builds the system and runs one JUnit test class.

-`ant -projecthelp`

Lists other build options

-`ant btf`

Build out the test frameworks to allow running a daemon and testing on local machine.
