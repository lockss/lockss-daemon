<Abstract>Background. Balloon non-crossable stenoses represent a challenging subset of coronary artery disease (CAD). They are clinically associated with patients who are older, frailer, and with multi-morbidities, and angiographically with increased tortuosity and coronary artery calcification. Combined rotational (RA) excimer laser coronary atherectomy (ELCA), or RASER, may facilitate stent delivery and deployment in non-crossable, non-dilatable severely calcified lesions. In this study, we assessed preliminary safety and efficacy of the RASER hybrid technique. Methods. RASER feasible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed at a large tertiary hospital in the northeast of England were retrospectively analyzed from September 1, 2008, to February 28, 2022. Major endpoints were in-hospital death from any cause, as well as procedural and angiographic success, defined by stent delivery with less than 50% residual stenosis and without clinical or angiographic complications, respectively. Results. From 74 unique cases, there were 28 RASER, 24 ELCA/RA, 16 balloon angioplasty Â± stenting, and 6 medically treated patients. In-hospital mortality rate was 5.2%, including 1 ELCA- and 3 RASER-treated patients. Successful stent delivery was achieved in significantly more RASER-treated patients compared to ELCA/RA- or balloon-treated patients: 96.4% (27/28), 25% (6/24), and 31.3% (5/16) respectively (P less than .001). Conclusions. In our retrospective, single-center study, patients with CAD who were deemed appropriate for RASER PCI had a high peri-procedural mortality rate. In this context, adjunctive RASER therapy provides acceptable safety and efficacy as a bailout strategy, with at least 3 out of 5 patients achieving satisfactory procedural and angiographic results. Randomized controlled trials are needed to comprehensively compare the clinical outcomes of high-risk RASER PCI vs conservative medical therapy.</Abstract>
