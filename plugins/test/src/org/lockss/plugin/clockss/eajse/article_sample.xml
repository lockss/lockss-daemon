      <Abstract>The use of fast food and soft drinks, coupled with a lack of physical activity and exercise, is causing a global increase in the number of overweight people. The study included 250 samples of 12-years-old children from 3 governmental primary schools and three private primary schools in Erbil City in Iraq. Data were compared between subjects with different variables using a statistical significance level of 0.05 and evaluated using Pearson Chi square or Fisher's exact tests. 24% of students were caries free, and the dental caries prevalence was 76%. Caries free were more common in boys 63% than girls 37%, with significant difference (P-value: 0.038), while caries more common in girls 53% than boys 47%, also 78% caries free were from private school students while 22% from governmental school with significance difference (P-value: 0.001). The caries presented in normal weighted students 77% while obese students only had about 4% with over weighted students having 19% with significance difference (P-value: 0.665). Fort canine eruption was more in boy students in governmental school 53%, while erupted canine was in girls 67% in private school. For normal weighted studentâ€™s canine were erupted 76%, while it was 20% in over weighted students and 4% in obese students, with significant difference (P-value: 0.016). Dental caries was more prevalent among students. The dental caries was higher among governmental school students than private school. Girl students had more caries than boys. The normal weighted students experienced higher caries prevalence than overweight/obese students.</Abstract>
