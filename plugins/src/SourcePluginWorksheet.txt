-------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, filling in the answer to questions. Cut and paste specific URLs to support your notes and to allow subsequent readers to understand your analysis.---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher:Publishing platform?:RT:RU:Is this triggered content (no longer available from publisher)?How is this content delivered to us?Pull (we take it from the publisher site)?    Update Schedule - to publisher outgoing site:    Removal Schedule - from publisher outgoing site:    Publisher pull site:Push (the publisher uploads it to our ftp site)?    Schedule:    Do they deliver only inremental content or may there be repeat content:Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin)Clockss? [yes/no]:		GLN? [yes/no]:			PLN? [and name thereof]:Does this content represent Books?Journals?Other?TDB information    PARAMS - global    PARAMS - journal specific    ATTRS:Base url: Where will we be serving the content from?:Is there a smaller development-only location for testing?:Start URL(s):How do we differentiate different AU's? For example, do we have year subdirectories below the base_url?Types of content:For a particular AU (usually, a year's worth of content), what types of files may be included    eg: *.pdf, *.xml *.epub, *.mobi, *.jpg, etc    How are these file types used:    eg: Each book has a <booknumber>.pdf with a corresponding <booknumber>.jpg of the cover        There are also *.xml files that identify the metadata for all the books included in the directoryNaming convention if identifiable:    eg: The files are a long number equivalent to the 2nd half of the DOI for the book, or        The file names are a combination of author name and abbreviated article title, or        The file name seems to be an arbitrary numberIs there anything in the AU directory that should NOT be collected?Notes: Anything else worth noting about the source content?----------------------SUBSTANCE DEFINITION--------------------------------------Which files in a directory define substance?    eg: *.pdf, but not *.xml    ------------------------ARTICLE ITERATION---------------------------------------Given the file types that may be provided for content, what is the map for contenttype to article target:    eg: <num>.pdf = FULL_TEXT_PDF; <num.jpg> = no target; etc    -----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------How is the publisher providing metadata for the content? We do not want to ingest sourcethat does not have accessible metadata. Scraping information out of a PDF file is not sufficient.Does the publisher provide XML files with metadata?  If so, does the XML file cover multiple books/articles or is there one XML file per item?  Is the XML file in a specific industry standard format (eg ONYX for Books)?    If it's straightforward, identify the XML format for basic metadata items (publisher, title, author)...      eg:          PUBLISHER: <Header><Publisher><PublisherName>XXXXX</PublisherName></Publisher></Header>          TITLE: <Product><ItemID><Title>xxxx</Title></ItemID></Product>          If not in XML, how is the metadata provided (full text html, RIS files, etc)?
