NOTE - after discussion we've decided to collect both the link (.xml) and the final (.pdf) without UrlCOnsumer in case they ever change or 
expose access to the pdf directly

citation form:

notes:  
1. Have not yet found full text html example across the journals to check images, figures
2. Do not use url consumer - get both the downloadpdf XML and PDF suffix versions
3. There is a wonky link

Abstract tab is foo.xml
PDF tab link is foo.xml?pdfVersion=true
but when on the Pdf tab, the pdf tab is a new link:
   foo.xml?&pdfVersion=true
   which looks like an error - maybe crawl rule out or does it not matter
   
Citation overlay is actually from this link:
https://www.berghahnjournals.com/cite/$002fjournals$002fboyhood-studies$002f10$002f2$002fbhs100206.xml/$N?nojs=true
Works also without the /$N?nojs=true part - could normalize that off

and the ris download is from this:
https://www.berghahnjournals.com/cite:exportcitation/ris?t:ac=$002fjournals$002fboyhood-studies$002f10$002f2$002fbhs100206.xml/$N&t:state:client=H4sIAAAAAAAAAD2OMU7DQBBFJyQIEF0aLkAJu04kaFJGihTFQkg5wcQe7InWu5udcYgbWkouwoWoqemoUuE0dP9JT0//8wfOX0cAMJAEq5AqgxGLmoxiJNHUPRj2SsmjM0JpzwWJmTsmr8+UhEX7tWBy5VpDwoqWTXS3K+q+fm8+Lr6P72cwzOG6CE0MvleXpcI43+IerUNf2bUm9tUsh6uXU+QJG9rBGwxyuIx97Z8PMSoM28QKozkrKdzZbWhPv8RuQleHUN6LtiWT2Elmp3ZTyyTLptmjOTTuDwEwRhDnAAAA   
but this works;
https://www.berghahnjournals.com/cite:exportcitation/ris?t:ac=$002fjournals$002fboyhood-studies$002f10$002f2$002fbhs100206.xml
so normalize off the args...
