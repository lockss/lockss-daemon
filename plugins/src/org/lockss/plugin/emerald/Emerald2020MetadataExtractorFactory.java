A web-based questionnaire has been developed and sent to a sample of IoT managers in order to understand how these firms set up new business in a global landscape. Findings show that the well-known Uppsala model seems to be exceeded in explaining the internationalization process of the IoT firms. These firms seem to be born-global firms in nature with a gradual approach to inter­nationalize. In particular, IoT firms seek to get a leading position within the domestic market before exploring foreign markets. Finally, the IoT managers confirmed these first evidences, highlighting that IoT firms are born global in nature with a gradual approach in exploring and exploiting new business opportunities abroad.">
