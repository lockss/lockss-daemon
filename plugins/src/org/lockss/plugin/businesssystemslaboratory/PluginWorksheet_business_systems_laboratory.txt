-------------------INSTRUCTIONS------------------------------------Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, filling in the answer to questions. Cut and paste specificURLs to support your notes and to allow subsequent readers to understand your analysis.---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: Business Systems LaboratoryPublishing platform: CustomRT: 5332RU: 4767JIRA: PD-138Plugin name suggestion: * org.lockss.plugin.businesssystemslaboratory.BusinessSystemsLaboratoryPluginClockss? [yes/no]: yes		GLN? [yes/no]:	   yesPLN? [and name thereof]: TDB information:    PARAMS - global    PARAMS - journal specific    ATTRS:Base url: (eg. http://www.pub-name.org/)(or does this vary by AU? If so, give multiple examples)* base_url, volume_name, yearStart URL(s):* http://www.business-systems-review.org/bsr_archive.htmIs the permission page in a different location? If so, where?How does the permission statement work?     (eg. text on html page, creative commons license, license that shows up under certain conditions, single permission page)* use Creative Common License, same location as start_urlPick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) base_url: http://www.business-systems-review.org/   volume_name: 2   year: 2013b)c)-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION---------------------Refetch Depth: 1* start_url http://www.business-systems-review.org/bsr_archive.htm points  to issue toc (list of articles abstracts and pdfs).What is the needed depth to pick up any new articles? Is this consistent for the site(s) layout? Does the publisher add items on a per-article basis or only on a per-issue basis?    Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predictable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.* initial crawl rules excerpt from the intitial  BusinessSystemsLaboratoryPlugin.xml  <entry>    <string>au_crawlrules</string>    <list>      <string>1,"^%s.*\.(bmp|css|gif|ico|jpe?g|js|png|tif?f|swf)$", base_url</string>      <string>4,"^%s", base_url</string>      <!-- http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.2.1.January-June.2013.htm  cache volume name -->      <string>1,"^%sBSR[.-]%s[.-][^/]+\.htm$", base_url, volume_name</string>      <!-- http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.2.1.January-June.2013.htm cache year -->      <string>1,"^%sBSR[^/]+[.-]%d\.htm$", base_url, year</string>      <!-- http://www.business-systems-review.org/Faruk.et.al..(2013).S.Q.Costs.Retail.Banking.2.1.htm -->      <string>1,"^%s[^/]+\(%d\)[^/]+\.htm$", base_url, year</string>      <!-- http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol.2-Iss.1-Faruk.et.al..S.Q.costs.Retail.Banking.pdf -->      <!-- http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol.1-n.1.Charles.Fran%C3%A7ois-Complexity.and.Systemic.models.PDF -->      <string>1,"^%sBSR[.-]Vol[.-]%s[.-][^/]+\.pdf$", base_url, volume_name</string>      <!-- complete issue http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR-Vol.2-Iss.1-2013-complete-issue.pdf -->      <!-- Complete Issue http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol.2-Iss.2-Symposium.Valencia.2013.Complete.Issue.pdf -->      <!-- Complete       http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR-Vol.1-ISS.1-June-December.2012.Complete.pdf -->      <!-- full issue     http://www.business-systems-review.org/Business_Systems_Review-Vol.2-Issue3-2013-full-issue.pdf -->      <!-- <string>1,"^%sBSR[^/]+[.-]%d[.-]complete([.-]issue)?\.pdf$", base_url, year</string> -->      <string>1,"^%s(BSR|Business_Systems_Review)[^/]+[.-]%d[.-](complete|full)([.-]issue)?\.pdf$", base_url, year</string>      <!-- http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.2.2.Special.Issue.Symposium.Valencia.2013.htm  -->      <string>1,"^%sBSR[^/]+Special[.-]Issue[^/]+[.-]%d\.htm$", base_url, year</string>    </list>  </entry>Journal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)* http://www.business-systems-review.org/index.htmlVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)* table lists multiple volumes (vol 1 for 2012 and vol 2 for 2013)  http://www.business-systems-review.org/bsr_archive.htmIssue Table of contents* the volume table list multiple issues for each volume.  each issue points to list of articles (abstracts and pdfs)  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.2.1.January-June.2013.htm Abstract* http://www.business-systems-review.org/Bardy.&.Massaro.(2013).Sustainability.Value.Index.2.1.htmPDF* http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol.2-Iss.1-Massaro.et.al.Organising.Innovation.pdf  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol.1-n.1.Charles.Fran%C3%A7ois-Complexity.and.Systemic.models.PDF  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol-1-Is.1.Hammami.Cash%20Flows.versus.Earnings.pdf  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol-1-Is.1.D'Allura.Galvagno.Mocciaro.RIS.pdf* complete issue pdfs  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR-Vol.2-Iss.1-2013-complete-issue.pdf  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.Vol.2-Iss.2-Symposium.Valencia.2013.Complete.Issue.pdfPDFPLUS(May be called enhanced PDF.

First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.  Are there multiple size options?  Can it be opened in a popup?  Does it open in its own page?  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?  Does it source from a different base url?* no images, figures and tables found, except logo, etc.  DOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)* no DOI useda)b)c)Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Addition Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, citedby, servlet, searchId, etc  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes   date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).Links to consider including  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base    underneath <base_url> and contains thins like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)* see crawl rules above for include/excluded linksDoes this site use automatically generated content?? View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.* not foundNotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION--------------------------As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdfwhereas arguments that might be unnecessary might look like this  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3nThese arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)* not found----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING----------------------------Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention. ------Look for these sorts of things. Remove this list and replace it with what you find---------  Name and/or logo of subscriber institution  Login identity in shopping cart area  Copyright on page showing year  Cited by section   Issue link which points to current issue  Product price listing  Footer section including adds or date  Related content or related article search  Impact factor or viewing count  Session historyAnd if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification datesfxlink javascript commands* http://www.business-systems-review.org/bsr_archive.htm  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.1.1.June-December.2012.htm  http://www.business-systems-review.org/BSR.2.2.Special.Issue.Symposium.Valencia.2013.htm    - top banner, top right approved image, right column,      amazon kindle app image, and bottom (creative common, etc.), script      ** the above should be hashed out.  However, this website looks home-grown,   the urls look static current.  Also, their html are not well-defined   with tags, labels, so it's hard to do hashing. Will hash out 'script'      Anything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING------------------------------If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from.  deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them. ------Look for these sorts of things. Remove this list and replace it with what you find---------  Cited By Section - a link or section of links which point to articles that reference this article  Corrigendum or Article Correction links  Related Content or Related Articles  Original Article (pointing back from a corrected article to the original)  Prev Issue/Next Issue links  Prev Article/Next Article links (sometimes these dead end at the ends of an issue, sometimes not)-----------------------PDF FILTER------------------------------------Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?In Acrobat viewer look at the properties of the file. Is the date today's date? If so it's likely to be generated on the fly. If so, note the URL of the PDF you downloaded.Now download the same PDF file a second time from a different browser (to ensure you're not getting cached version)In a terminal window go to the directory that contain these two different versions of the same PDF file and run:%diff -a pdf_version1.pdf pdf_version2.pdfIf there is a difference note that here and give the URL to the URL you tested.* downloaded 2 pdfs in different days and did diff -a, the results are  the same:    BSR.Vol.1-Iss.1-Oke.Azeez-Strong-form.efficiency.Nigerian.Capital.Market.pdf    BSR.Vol.1-n.1. Dominici.Gandolfo-Why.does.systems.thinking.matter.pdf-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION---------------------------Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.View the page source and search for the following "<meta" there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file (ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.  Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?* metadata found from abtract pages, although there migh be html syntax error  since firefox does not list out the metadata.  Perhaps "meta name" should  be "<meta name":    http://www.business-systems-review.org/Bosch.et.al.%282013%29.Complex.Responsible.2.2.1st.Int.Symposium.htm    <font size="1" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">meta name="citation_title" content=&quot;Network  Approach and Stakeholder Management<span lang="it">&quot;</span>&gt;&lt;meta name="citation_author" content=&quot;<span lang="it">Mauro Sciarelli</span>"&gt;<span lang="it">  </span>&lt;meta<span lang="it">  </span>name="citation_publication_date" content=&quot;201<span lang="it">3</span>/<span lang="it">04</span>/<span lang="it">01</span>"&gt;&lt;meta name="citation_journal_title" content="Business Systems Review"&gt;&lt;meta name="citation_volume" content="<span lang="it">2</span>"&gt;&lt;meta name="citation_issue" content=&quot;<span lang="it">2</span>"&gt;&lt;meta name="citation_firstpage" content="<span lang="it">175</span>"&gt;&lt;meta name="citation_lastpage" content="<span lang="it">190</span>"&gt;&lt;meta name="citation_pdf_url" content="</font>
