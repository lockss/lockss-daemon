AB  - Pasture bloat is a major deterrent to the grazing of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pastures by ruminants, despite the high growth rates that are obtainable. Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.), a condensed tannin-containing legume, is known to reduce alfalfa pasture bloat in mixed stands. Experiments were conducted in 2010 to 2012 at Lethbridge, AB, using two sainfoin/cultivar AC Blue J alfalfa mixed pastures originally seeded as 50:50 mixes in 2008 and rotationally grazed by steers (Bos taurus). New sainfoin population cultivar LRC-3519 specifically selected for improved performance under a multi-cut system, persisted better (29% of total herbage dry matter [DM]) compared to cultivar Nova (5%) after two cycles of rotational grazing in each year. Bloat incidence and severity in steers were reduced (P < 0.001) by 98% in LRC-3519 mixed stands compared to Nova mixtures when Angus steers grazed sainfoin/alfalfa mixed pastures under conditions for maximizing bloat occurrence. In a separate crop preference study during 2011–2012, eight steers were randomly paired and assigned to four alfalfa and sainfoin strip pastures to determine DM utilization and time spent grazing the two forages. Steers spent more time (55%) in alfalfa strips compared to sainfoin and grazed more (P < 0.05) alfalfa (2048 kg DM) than sainfoin (1164 kg DM). In spite of higher preference for alfalfa, a high proportion of new sainfoin in mixed alfalfa stands reduced risk of bloat substantially in cattle grazing mixed alfalfa/sainfoin pasture.

AB  - The unprecedented rate of annual bee die-offs in recent years has made worldwide news. While the exact cause of these losses remains elusive, research suggests that modern agricultural production practices play an outsized role as a changing agricultural landscape puts pressure on both wild and domesticated bee species. What are some of the ways that farmers and CCAs can promote bee health?

AB  - Poultry litter (PL) is a by-product of broiler production. Most PL is land applied. Land-applied PL is a valuable nutrient source for crop production but can also be a route of environmental contamination with manure-borne bacteria. The objective of this study was to characterize the fate of pathogens, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and bacteria containing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after application of PL to soils under conventional till or no-till management. This 2-yr study was conducted in accordance with normal agricultural practices, and microbial populations were quantified using a combination of culture and quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Initial concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni in PL were 5.4 ± 3.2 × 106 cells g-1 PL; Salmonella sp. was not detected in the PL but was enriched periodically from PL-amended soils. Escherichia coli was detected in PL (1.5 ± 1.3 × 102 culturable or 1.5 ± 0.3 × 107 genes g-1) but was rarely detected in field soils, whereas enterococci (1.5 ± 0.5 × 108 cells g-1 PL) were detected throughout the study. These results suggest that enterococci may be better FIB for field-applied PL. Concentrations of ARGs for sulfonamide, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance increased up to 3.0 orders of magnitude after PL application and remained above background for up to 148 d. These data provide new knowledge about important microbial FIB, pathogens, and ARGs associated with PL application under realistic field-based conditions.
