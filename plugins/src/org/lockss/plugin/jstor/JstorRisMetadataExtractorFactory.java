/*
 * This RIS extractor is used by both legacy JSTOR as well as JSTOR Current Scholarship
 * Legacy: https://www.jstor.org/action/downloadSingleCitationSec?format=refman&doi=10.5325/chaucerrev.49.1.0001
 * New: http://www.jstor.org/citation/ris/10.2307/40835452
 * 
 * For Legacy:
 * The RIS url is manufactured by a link extractor using the DOI on the TOC page 
 * before collecting and emitting, make sure the corresponding pdf or 
 * full text html is in the AU
 * The RIS file will exist even for a bogus DOI, it's just that the contents
 * will be blank. So do a validation check on the RIS file.
 * 
 * For new:
 * The RIS comes from a link so is valid. Do the check anyway, because why not
 * 
 * Leave the ISSN uncooked and it will come from the TDB more consistently
 * 
 * If the DOI is missing - you can get it from the metadata url
