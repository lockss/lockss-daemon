<!--  This plugin is exactly like BaseAtyponBooksPlugin
      with the added crawl rule restriction that uses the book_eisbn param in the 
      doi for book landing and for chapters 
      Publishers that follow this model should use this more restrictive parent
      to avoid overcrawling issues.
         see: PracticalAction, Emerald, Endocrine, NRC, SEG, SIAM         
      Books that do NOT, must use BaseAtyponBooksPlugin directly and be extra
      careful with their crawl filter
         see: AIAA, FutureScience, Liverpool and Wageningen
     NOTE: any changes to the crawl rules in BaseAtyponBooksPlugin must be
     added here

    <!--  CRAWL COMMENT BLOCK
    RESTRICTED book plugin - the doi is limited to a prefix plus a 2nd section based on the book eISBN
     - it might have a prefix and a suffix, but it contains the eisbn - such as:
