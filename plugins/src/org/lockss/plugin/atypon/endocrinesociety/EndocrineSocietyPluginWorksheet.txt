Is the permission page in a different location? If so, where?
* same location as start_url

How does the permission statement work? 
* text on html page: 
CLOCKSS system has permission to ingest, preserve, and serve this Archival Unit.

Pick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. 
Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.
(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)

a) base_url: http://press.endocrine.org/
   journal_id: edrv
   volume_name: 35
   start_url: http://press.endocrine.org/clockss/edrv/35/index.html
b) base_url: http://press.endocrine.org/
   journal_id: endo
   volume_name: 154
   start_url: http://press.endocrine.org/clockss/endo/154/index.html

   volume_name: 26
   start_url: http://press.endocrine.org/clockss/mend/26/index.html

-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------
Refetch Depth (default is 1)
What is the needed depth to pick up any new articles? Is this consistent for the site(s) layout? 
Does the publisher add items on a per-article basis or only on a per-issue basis?
(explanatory examples - delete this when writing up analysis) 
  If the start_url is a manifest page for an entire volume and has links for the issues in that volume, then a refetch depth of 1 would refetch 
  anything on that first level, including any new issues added to the volume since the previous crawl.  But it would not fetch any new articles
  added to an existing issue table of contents. With a refetch depth of 2 you would go on to each issue listed on the manifest page and if they
  are a table of contents with links to each article, you would see and fetch any newly added article links. 
* refetch depth is 2    

Crawl rules & Content Layout
Is there a predictable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? 
Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably 
only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are 
applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists. If you can 
generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.
* use BaseAtyponPlugin crawl rules

Images, Figures & Tables
These items may exist in several formats, locations and with multiple access options.  First locate an 
article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an 
embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.

  Are there multiple size options?
  Can it be opened in a popup?
  Does it open in its own page?
  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)?
  Does it source from a different base url?

** From analysis review: The images are handled using window.figureViewer and the support for this is waiting on 1.67. 
I will put it in to BaseAtypon at that point and this plugin will get the correct link extraction automatically 
but the plugin cannot go to smoke test until this is happens (same as Maney, BritishInstituteofRadiology).
This means that until Daemon1.67, the medium and large images are not collected.
Example: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/en.2012-2147
<a title="Open Figure Viewer" onclick="showFigures(this,event); 
return false;" href="JavaScript:void(0);" class="thumbnail">
<img alt="figure" src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/endo/journals/content/endo/2013/endo.2013.154.issue-10/en.2012-2147/20140211/images/small/zee9991371920002.g.gif">

DOI pattern
If this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)
* doi not used

a)
b)
c)

Other? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.

Addition Links to Include/Exclude
Now go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at 
all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  
Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or excluded 
(that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.

Links to consider excluding
  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, citedby, servlet, searchId, etc
  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically generated (includes 
  date or hash string in the name, eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).

Links to consider including
  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images that live under a different base  
  underneath <base_url> and contains thins like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)

Does this site use automatically generated content?? 
View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:
   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...
   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...
  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.  Please note the URL.


Notes
Anything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.

--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION-------------------------------------
As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of 
your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be 
separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:
  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdf
whereas arguments that might be unnecessary might look like this
  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3n
These arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the 
arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.
Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)



----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING---------------------------------------
Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. 
These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source 
to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be removed.  
Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of items you find 
and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the items you mention.

 ------Look for these sorts of things. Remove this list and replace it with what you find---------
  Name and/or logo of subscriber institution
  Login identity in shopping cart area
  Copyright on page showing year
  Cited by section 
  Issue link which points to current issue
  Product price listing
  Footer section including adds or date
  Related content or related article search
  Impact factor or viewing count
  Session history

And if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:
<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification date
sfxlink javascript commands

Anything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??

  - pageHeader
  - nav journal - current past issues, about, authors
  - breadcrumbs
  - next/previous article
  - free.gif image
  - MathJax_Message
  - accessIconContainer (ex: http://press.endocrine.org/toc/edrv/35/3)
  - top panel with 'subscribe'
  - choose drop box (sectionJumpTo in full text)
  - right column - all except Download Citation
    http://press.endocrine.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1210%2Fjc.2013-1811
  - support and help block in showCitFormats pages
  - pageFooter

-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------
If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal 
id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume an article is from. 
 deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf
 non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12
which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, 
write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places where this could happen, such as those 
listed below. If you find some, please provide the URL for the page where you saw them.

 ------Look for these sorts of things. Remove this list and replace it with what you find---------
  Cited By Section - a link or section of links which point to articles that reference this article
  Corrigendum or Article Correction links
  Related Content or Related Articles
  Original Article (pointing back from a corrected article to the original)
  Prev Issue/Next Issue links
  Prev Article/Next Article links (sometimes these dead end at the ends of an issue, sometimes not)

* At TOC level:
  - Top banner
  - Nav with current issue and past issues
  - Previous issue / Next issue

* At Article level:
  - Top banner
  - Nav with current issue and past issues
  - Previous article / Next articles
  - Related content. Example in the Erratum section near the bottom of 
  http://press.endocrine.org/toc/endo/154/10
  - external links within Table figures or middle of a paragraph

This related content expands to Original Article containing links to other volume 153 issue 8.

-----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------
Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. 
Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date 
downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?
In Acrobat viewer look at the properties of the file. Is the date today's date? 
If so it's likely to be generated on the fly. 
If so, note the URL of the PDF you downloaded.

Now download the same PDF file a second time from a different browser (to ensure you're not getting cached version)

In a terminal window go to the directory that contain these two different versions of the same PDF file and run:
%diff -a pdf_version1.pdf pdf_version2.pdf
If there is a difference note that here and give the URL to the URL you tested.
* downloaded http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/er.2013-1067 in 2 different days and did ?diff ?a?, there is no difference.
==> on 21sep2014 the above downloaded page had no watermark.  But today 01nov2014, there is watermark.
another example is http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/en.2012-2190 and 
http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/en.2012-1931.
* the watermark text is at the bottom of the pdf"
* Thib checked the watermark of the pdfs with and 
without 'LOCKSS cache' user agent. The pdfs are served consistently with 
the watermark. Unlike the case of Society of Exploration Geophysicists, 
the pdfs on one content machine had watermark and not the other. 
Will wait until this plugin is released to content machines, then run tests 
and determine whether or not a pdf filter is needed.

-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------
Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. 
For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the html of 
an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  
See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:

View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). 
You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.

View the page source and search for the following "<meta" 
there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.

Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file 
(ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.  

Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?

* Metadata can be found in:
* ris, endnote, bibtex, medlars from Download Citation form http://press.endocrine.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1210%2Fer.2013-1067
* abstract and full text html.
