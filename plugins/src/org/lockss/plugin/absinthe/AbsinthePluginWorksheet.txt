-------------------INSTRUCTIONS-------------------------------------Make a local copy of this file for each new plugin. Change its name to match the name of the plugin XML file, but with the .txt suffix. As you do your site analysis for the new plugin, follow along in this worksheet, filling in the answer to questions.  Cut and paste specific URLs to support your notes and to allow subsequent readers to  understand your analysis.---------------------GENERAL INFORMATION-----------------------------Name of publisher: Absinthe Literary ReviewPublishing platform?: gln??RT:RU:4661Plugin name suggestion: (eg. PubNamePlugin) AbsinthePluginClockss? [yes/no]:		noGLN? [yes/no]:			yesPLN? [and name thereof]:  noTDB information:    PARAMS - global      base_url = http://absintheliteraryreview.com/    PARAMS - journal specific      year    ATTRS:Base url: (eg. http://www.pub-name.org/) http://absintheliteraryreview.com/(or does this vary by AU? If so, give multiple examples)Start URL(s):<base_url>/archives<au_short_year>.htm Is the permission page in a different location? If so, where?How does the permission statement work?     (eg. text on html page, creative commons license, license that shows up under     certain conditions, single permission page)        permission statement is listed on the manifest page as visible textPick 3 AUs that you are using for initial evaluation? Write down their defined parameters. Choose AUs across a variety of journals (if available) and years to get a broad view of the publisher.(eg. Journal ID = abc; Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.baseau-blah.org, etc)a) Volume = 2003; base_url = http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/archives03.htmb) Volume = 2004; base_url = http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/archives04.htmc) Volume = 2005; base_url = http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/archives05.htm-----------------------URL & SITE LAYOUT SECTION-----------------------Crawl rules & Content LayoutIs there a predictable URL pattern specific to each type of page/content? Below is a list of possible pages and types of content. This site will probably  only contain a subset. Examine the AUs you chose above and note which items are  applicable and give one or more URL examples for each that exists.  If you can generalize to a pattern (eg. <base_url>/<toc/<journal_id>/<volume_name>/### ) then do so.Journal Front Page (we won't collect, but need to know)  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.comVolume Table of Contents (May or may not be same as start url)  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/archives03.htmIssue Table of contents  None foundAbstract  None foundPDF  None foundPDFPLUS(May be called enhanced PDF. Look at a page - is it a PDF with active links or is it a  PDF embedded within an html frame? Note this information)  None foundPDF Landing Page(This is a page with information on it with a link to the PDF or to allow download of the PDF. This may be the same as the abstract)  None foundFull text HTML  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/stories/anders.htm  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/poetics/ang2.htm  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/book_reviews/ballantine.htm  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/archives/sloan4.htmPrint friendly version option  NoSupplementary info  None foundCitation information (also note format options - may be RIS, Bibtex, endnote, etc)  None foundReference files  None foundAudio or Video?   None foundImages, Figures & TablesThese items may exist in several formats, locations and with multiple access options.  First locate an article that includes images/figures/tables. If there is a full text html option, start there. Find an embedded image (figure, table) and note the following, giving URL examples for each.  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/images/homebotl.jpg  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/images/back2.jpg    Images (gif & jpg are in <base_url>/images  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/stories/_derived/anders.htm_txt_header.gif    Article specific images are in _derived subdirectory (under stories, poetics, etc)  Are there multiple size options? no  Can it be opened in a popup? no  Does it open in its own page? no  Is it accessed via javacript (through an image viewer)? no  Does it source from a different base url? noDOI patternIf this publisher uses DOIs, they may follow a pattern. It can be helpful to know what the pattern is. Give 3 examples of DOIs for this publisher including both parts (eg 101234/Blah_xxx124Is1)  None foundOther? Any other content specific to an article that wasn't listed above?? Give examples.Addition Links to Include/ExcludeNow go back to both an issue table of contents page (or equivalent) AND an article html page and look at  all the links on this page. This is easiest to do in firefox --> Page Info [Links tab].  Scan all the links and note items that might need to be explicitly included or  excluded (that wouldn't be under normal paths). If in doubt, just add an example URL in here.Links to consider excluding  underneath <base_url>, but includes something general, such as author info, citedby,   servlet, searchId, etc  javascript or style sheet links that seem to have a name that might be automatically   generated (includes date or hash string in the name,   eg. <base_url>/cssJawr/N1854254985/style.css or LEKEJEEHEJ334449595.css).    http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/book_reviews/book_reviews.htm      This page includes links to content from more than one AU.    http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/submit.htm    http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/links.htm    http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/books.htm    http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/cgi-bin/cgi2/g2estbook.cgi"Links to consider including  not underneath <base_url>, but looks specific to article content, such as images  that live under a different base    underneath <base_url> and contains things like showSupplements, showImage, downloadCitation)    None foundDoes this site use automatically generated content? View the page source for an article html page and look for something in the <head> section that looks like:   __viewstate.X29DKTUELDKDHFLDKDN...   __eventstate.KDIEJTEJSDODIJGJEKE...  These types of items are generated by ASP and will change with each viewing of the page.   Please note the URL.    None foundNotesAnything else that you think the plugin writer needs to be aware of in terms of URL layout.--------------------------URL NORMALIZATION---------------------------------------------As you click around from article to article or issue TOC are you getting arguments on the end of your URLs that are likely unnecessary.  Arguments are those items that follow a ? and may be separated with &.  Arguments that are necessary to identify the page usually look like this:  ?showItem=<identifier>&format=pdfwhereas arguments that might be unnecessary might look like this  ?rss=13&prev_item=333kfkfkfjk&lang=3nThese arguments might be keeping track of browsing history or date or language. You can test whether the arguments are needed by re-entering the URL without the arguments and seeing if you get the same page.Give examples of URLs with arguments that we might need to remove. (eg. <full_url>?cookieSet=1 or <full_url>?prevSearch=3)    None found----------------------HTML HASH FILTERING-----------------------------------------Look at several types of html pages and look for types of items that are time or viewer dependent. These items will need to get hashed out. The plugin writer will need to go in to the page source  to figure out how to remove the items, but you can identify which elements likely need to be  removed.  Here are suggestions for the type of things to look for. Make a note of the type of  items you find and why you think they will need removal.  Give any URLs necessary to find the  items you mention.  None foundAnd if you view the page source (firefox -> Page Source) look for the following:<script/> tags with subscriber information, dates, or <!-- ... --> comment pairs that includes creation or modification datesfxlink javascript commandsAnything else you think might need to be removed from hashing??  None found-------------------HTML CRAWL FILTERING----------------------------------------If the URL pattern for articles is non-deterministic (that is, it doesn't contain volume,  year, journal id specific information) then there is no way to know which journal/issue/volume  an article is from.  deterministic URL: <base_url>/content/vol24/iss1/art1.pdf non-deterministic URL: <base_url/content/doi/pdf/11134/myartdoi12which makes it very possible to crawl to content not from the original AU. If this is not the case, write "not applicable" or if it is, look for likely places  where this could happen, such as those listed below. If you find some, please provide  the URL for the page where you saw them.   http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/archives.htm  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/authors.htm  http://www.absintheliteraryreview.com/index.html  -----------------------PDF FILTER--------------------------------------------Some PDF files change every time they're viewed and will require a PDF filter. Download a PDF file of an article and view it. Does it contain an obvious watermark with date downloaded or some other time/viewer specific information?In Acrobat viewer look at the properties of the file. Is the date today's date? If so it's likely to be generated on the fly.  If so, note the URL of the PDF you downloaded.Now download the same PDF file a second time from a different browser (to ensure you're not getting cached version)In a terminal window go to the directory that contain these two different versions of the same PDF file and run:%diff -a pdf_version1.pdf pdf_version2.pdfIf there is a difference note that here and give the URL to the URL you tested.  no PDFs found, not applicable-----------------------METADATA EXTRACTION--------------------------------------Metadata is provided in a variety of ways depending on the publisher. For example, Atypon plugins usually provide metadata in <meta.../> tags embedded in the  html of an abstract and/or full text html page.  This only concerns article pages, not TOC pages.  See if this is the case. Go to an article abstract or html page and do two things:View the page info (firefox -> Page Info [General]). You should see a listing of metadata,  with names  such as dc.Title, dc. Creator, author, content_publisher, and then a value.View the page source and search for the following "<meta" there should be about as many of these as there were items listed on the General Page Info page.Other ways a publisher might provide metadata (if not as above) is as a downloadable citation file (ris, endnote, bibtex, etc). If so, please provide the format options and some examples for download.  Some publishers don't provide explicit metadata and we need to parse the source html for basic information. Is that the case?  I think there are no metatags available, and content will need to be parsed   and/or derived from tdb
